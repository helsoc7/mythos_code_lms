topic: "Grundlagen"
subtopic: "Kommentare"
level: "easy"
explanation: "In Python, single-line comments begin with the # symbol. Everything following the # on that line is ignored by the Python interpreter. Multi-line comments can be created using triple quotes (''' or \"\"\")."
explanationWrong:
  - "// is used for comments in languages like JavaScript and C++, not in Python."
  - "/* */ is used for multi-line comments in languages like C and Java, not in Python."
  - "-- is used for comments in SQL, not in Python."
---
### Question 1: Which symbol is used to start a comment in Python?
- [ ] //
- [x] #
- [ ] /* */
- [ ] --

topic: "Datentypen"
subtopic: "String-Formatierung"
level: "medium"
explanation: "Python's f-strings (formatted string literals) allow embedding expressions inside string literals using curly braces {}. The expression inside the braces is evaluated at runtime and then formatted according to the format specifier. In this case, 42 is formatted to show only 2 decimal places, resulting in '42.00'."
explanationWrong:
  - "The format specifier .2f shows 2 decimal places, not just the first 2 digits."
  - "The f-string would not produce an error with this valid syntax."
  - "The output would include decimal places as specified by .2f."
---
### Question 2: What is the output of the following code?
```python
number = 42
print(f"The answer is {number:.2f}")
```
- [ ] The answer is 42
- [x] The answer is 42.00
- [ ] The answer is 4.20
- [ ] A syntax error is raised

---
topic: "Datenstrukturen"
subtopic: "Tupel"
level: "easy"
explanation: "Unlike lists, tuples in Python are immutable, which means they cannot be modified after creation. Attempting to change an element in a tuple results in a TypeError."
explanationWrong:
  - "Tuples are immutable and cannot be modified after creation."
  - "The operation would not simply be ignored - it raises an error."
  - "The tuple would not automatically convert to a list to allow modification."
---
### Question 3: What happens when you try to modify an element in a tuple?
```python
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
my_tuple[0] = 5
```
- [ ] The first element of the tuple changes to 5
- [ ] Nothing happens, the operation is ignored
- [x] A TypeError is raised
- [ ] The tuple is automatically converted to a list

---
topic: "Schleifen"
subtopic: "For-Schleifen"
level: "medium"
explanation: "In Python, the range() function with a single argument n generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to n-1. When used in a for loop, it iterates n times. In this case, range(4) generates the sequence 0, 1, 2, 3, and the for loop iterates 4 times."
explanationWrong:
  - "range(4) generates values from 0 to 3, not 1 to 4."
  - "The loop will execute exactly 4 times, not 3 times."
  - "range(4) does not include 4, it goes from 0 to 3."
---
### Question 4: How many times will the following loop execute?
```python
for i in range(4):
    print(i)
```
- [ ] 3 times
- [x] 4 times
- [ ] 5 times
- [ ] The loop will run indefinitely

---
topic: "Funktionen"
subtopic: "Funktionsdefinition"
level: "easy"
explanation: "In Python, we define a function using the 'def' keyword followed by the function name, parentheses, and a colon. The function body starts on the next line and must be indented."
explanationWrong:
  - "function is not the correct keyword to define functions in Python."
  - "func is not the correct keyword to define functions in Python."
  - "def is the correct keyword, but we need a colon after the parentheses."
---
### Question 5: What is the correct way to define a function in Python?
- [ ] `function my_function():`
- [ ] `func my_function():`
- [x] `def my_function():`
- [ ] `def my_function() {`

---
topic: "Print_Input"
subtopic: "Nutzereingabe"
level: "easy"
explanation: "The input() function in Python reads a line from the standard input (usually the keyboard) and returns it as a string. If a prompt string is provided as an argument, it displays this prompt to the user before reading the input."
explanationWrong:
  - "get() is not a standard Python function for user input."
  - "read() is not a standard Python function for user input."
  - "scan() is not a standard Python function for user input."
---
### Question 6: Which function is used to get user input in Python?
- [ ] get()
- [ ] read()
- [x] input()
- [ ] scan()

---
topic: "Datentypen"
subtopic: "Listen-Methoden"
level: "medium"
explanation: "The extend() method adds all elements of an iterable (like another list) to the end of the current list. In this case, the list [4, 5] is added to numbers, making numbers contain [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]."
explanationWrong:
  - "The extend() method adds each element of the iterable, not the iterable itself."
  - "The original list is modified in-place; a new list is not created."
  - "The extend() method does not concatenate the lists as separate entries."
---
### Question 7: What is the result of the following code?
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
numbers.extend([4, 5])
print(numbers)
```
- [x] [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
- [ ] [1, 2, 3, [4, 5]]
- [ ] [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]]
- [ ] [4, 5]

---
topic: "Grundlagen"
subtopic: "Wahrheitswerte"
level: "medium"
explanation: "The logical operators in Python are evaluated in a short-circuit manner. In the expression 'False and True or True', first 'False and True' is evaluated to False (since both operands must be True for 'and' to be True), then 'False or True' is evaluated to True (since at least one operand must be True for 'or' to be True)."
explanationWrong:
  - "The operator precedence is important: 'and' is evaluated before 'or'."
  - "The correct evaluation is (False and True) or True, which is False or True, which evaluates to True."
  - "The expression does not result in a syntax error."
---
### Question 8: What is the result of the following expression?
```python
False and True or True
```
- [ ] False
- [x] True
- [ ] None
- [ ] Syntax Error

---
topic: "Datenstrukturen"
subtopic: "Dictionaries"
level: "medium"
explanation: "The keys() method of a dictionary returns a view object that displays all the keys in the dictionary. When converted to a list, it provides a list of all keys. The user_info dictionary has the keys 'name', 'age', and 'city'."
explanationWrong:
  - "The keys() method returns only the keys, not the values."
  - "The keys() method returns all keys, not just the first key."
  - "The method does not raise a ValueError; it's a valid operation on dictionaries."
---
### Question 9: What will the following code output?
```python
user_info = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}
print(list(user_info.keys()))
```
- [x] ['name', 'age', 'city']
- [ ] ['John', 30, 'New York']
- [ ] ['name']
- [ ] ValueError

---
topic: "Schleifen"
subtopic: "While-Schleifen"
level: "easy"
explanation: "A while loop in Python executes as long as the condition is True. In this example, the condition is 'count < 5'. The loop starts with count = 0, and in each iteration, count is incremented by 1. The loop will execute until count reaches 5, which means it executes 5 times."
explanationWrong:
  - "The loop executes for count values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 - that's 5 iterations."
  - "The loop stops when count reaches 5, not 4."
  - "The loop has a clear termination condition and won't run indefinitely."
---
### Question 10: How many times will the following while loop execute?
```python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```
- [ ] 4 times
- [x] 5 times
- [ ] 6 times
- [ ] The loop will run indefinitely

---
topic: "Funktionen"
subtopic: "RÃ¼ckgabewerte"
level: "medium"
explanation: "If a function in Python has multiple return statements, the first one that is executed will determine the function's return value. In this case, since 7 > 5, the condition is True, and the function returns 'Hello'. The second return statement is never reached."
explanationWrong:
  - "The function only returns the first value that meets the condition, not both values."
  - "The condition 7 > 5 is True, so 'Hello' is returned."
  - "The function does not return None; a valid return statement is executed."
---
### Question 11: What is the output of the following code?
```python
def return_test():
    if 7 > 5:
        return "Hello"
    return "World"

print(return_test())
```
- [x] Hello
- [ ] World
- [ ] Hello World
- [ ] None

---
topic: "Datentypen"
subtopic: "Boolean-Operationen"
level: "medium"
explanation: "In Python, certain values are considered 'falsy', meaning they evaluate to False in a boolean context. These include: None, False, zero of any numeric type (0, 0.0), empty sequences ('', [], ()), and empty mappings ({}). Every other value is considered 'truthy' and evaluates to True."
explanationWrong:
  - "0 evaluates to False, not True."
  - "Empty lists [] evaluate to False, not True."
  - "Empty strings '' evaluate to False, not True."
---
### Question 12: Which of the following values evaluates to True in a boolean context?
- [ ] 0
- [ ] []
- [x] "False"
- [ ] None

---
topic: "Grundlagen"
subtopic: "Operatoren"
level: "easy"
explanation: "The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division. In this case, 17 divided by 5 is 3 with a remainder of 2, so 17 % 5 equals 2."
explanationWrong:
  - "17 % 5 is 2, not 3 (which would be the quotient)."
  - "17 % 5 is 2, not 3.4 (which would be the floating-point result of 17/5)."
  - "17 % 5 is 2, not 5 (which would be the divisor)."
---
### Question 13: What is the result of the expression 17 % 5?
- [ ] 3
- [x] 2
- [ ] 3.4
- [ ] 5

---
topic: "Print_Input"
subtopic: "Formatierung"
level: "medium"
explanation: "The .format() method in Python allows for variable substitution and value formatting. In this case, the {} placeholders are replaced with the values provided to the format method in order: 'Alice' and 25."
explanationWrong:
  - "The .format() method replaces the placeholder {} with the provided values."
  - "The placeholders are replaced with the actual values, not the variable names."
  - "The .format() method does not cause an error with valid syntax."
---
### Question 14: What will the following code output?
```python
name = 'Alice'
age = 25
print("My name is {} and I am {} years old.".format(name, age))
```
- [x] My name is Alice and I am 25 years old.
- [ ] My name is name and I am age years old.
- [ ] My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.
- [ ] Error: invalid format

---
topic: "Datenstrukturen"
subtopic: "Sets"
level: "medium"
explanation: "Sets in Python store unique values and automatically remove duplicates. When a list with duplicate elements is converted to a set, the duplicates are eliminated. In this case, the set will contain only unique values from the list: 3, 1, 2, 4."
explanationWrong:
  - "Sets do not maintain the original order of elements."
  - "The set removes duplicates, so the result should have 4 elements, not 6."
  - "Creating a set from a list with duplicates is a valid operation and doesn't raise an error."
---
### Question 15: What will be the output of the following code?
```python
numbers = [3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1]
unique_numbers = set(numbers)
print(unique_numbers)
```
- [ ] {3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1}
- [ ] [3, 1, 2, 4]
- [x] {1, 2, 3, 4}
- [ ] TypeError

---
topic: "Funktionen"
subtopic: "Parameter"
level: "medium"
explanation: "The * operator in function parameters is used to collect all remaining positional arguments into a tuple. In this function, a and b receive the first two arguments, and args collects any additional arguments into a tuple. The call collect_args(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) assigns 1 to a, 2 to b, and (3, 4, 5) to args."
explanationWrong:
  - "args will contain a tuple of the remaining arguments after a and b, not just one value."
  - "args will be a tuple (3, 4, 5), not the list [3, 4, 5]."
  - "The function will not raise an error with extra arguments because *args handles them."
---
### Question 16: What will be the value of args in the following code?
```python
def collect_args(a, b, *args):
    return args

result = collect_args(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
print(result)
```
- [ ] 3
- [ ] [3, 4, 5]
- [x] (3, 4, 5)
- [ ] TypeError

---
topic: "Schleifen"
subtopic: "Iteration"
level: "medium"
explanation: "When iterating over a dictionary in Python with a for loop, you iterate over its keys by default. To iterate over both keys and values, the items() method must be used. In this code, only the keys ('a', 'b', 'c') are printed."
explanationWrong:
  - "The loop iterates over the keys, not the values."
  - "The loop does not print key-value pairs without using items()."
  - "The loop executes normally and does not raise an exception."
---
### Question 17: What will be the output of the following code?
```python
my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
for item in my_dict:
    print(item)
```
- [x] a
b
c
- [ ] 1
2
3
- [ ] a 1
b 2
c 3
- [ ] Error: dictionaries are not iterable

---
topic: "Datentypen"
subtopic: "String-Manipulation"
level: "medium"
explanation: "The replace() method returns a new string with all occurrences of the first argument replaced by the second argument. In this case, all occurrences of 'o' in 'Hello World' are replaced with 'a', resulting in 'Hella Warld'."
explanationWrong:
  - "The replace() method replaces all occurrences of the substring, not just the first one."
  - "The original string is not modified; a new string is returned."
  - "The replace() method is case-sensitive and will only replace exact matches."
---
### Question 18: What is the output of the following code?
```python
text = "Hello World"
new_text = text.replace("o", "a")
print(new_text)
```
- [ ] Hello World
- [ ] Hella World
- [x] Hella Warld
- [ ] Hello Warld

---
topic: "Grundlagen"
subtopic: "Variablen"
level: "easy"
explanation: "Python allows multiple variable assignment in a single line. In this code, the variables a, b, and c are assigned the values 1, 2, and 3 respectively."
explanationWrong:
  - "The values are assigned in order: a=1, b=2, c=3."
  - "This is valid Python syntax for multiple assignment."
  - "Python does not sum the values; it assigns them individually to each variable."
---
### Question 19: What values will a, b, and c have after executing the following code?
```python
a, b, c = 1, 2, 3
```
- [x] a=1, b=2, c=3
- [ ] a=1, b=1, c=1
- [ ] a=3, b=2, c=1
- [ ] SyntaxError

---
topic: "Print_Input"
subtopic: "Ausgabe"
level: "easy"
explanation: "The print() function in Python outputs the specified object(s) to the standard output device (screen). By default, it adds a newline character at the end, which can be changed using the 'end' parameter."
explanationWrong:
  - "printf() is a function in C, not Python."
  - "echo() is a function in PHP and a command in shell scripting, not Python."
  - "console.log() is a function in JavaScript, not Python."
---
### Question 20: Which function is used to display output in Python?
- [x] print()
- [ ] printf()
- [ ] echo()
- [ ] console.log()

---
topic: "Datenstrukturen"
subtopic: "Listen-Slicing"
level: "medium"
explanation: "List slicing in Python follows the format list[start:stop:step]. In this case, numbers[1:6:2] selects elements starting from index 1 up to (but not including) index 6, with a step of 2. This gives us elements at indices 1, 3, and 5, which are 2, 4, and 6."
explanationWrong:
  - "The slice includes elements at indices 1, 3, and 5, not starting from 0."
  - "The slice uses a step of 2, not 1, so it doesn't include all elements from 1 to 5."
  - "The slice specifies both start and stop indices, not the entire list."
---
### Question 21: What will be the output of the following code?
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
print(numbers[1:6:2])
```
- [ ] [1, 3, 5]
- [x] [2, 4, 6]
- [ ] [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
- [ ] [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

---
topic: "Funktionen"
subtopic: "Lambda-Funktionen"
level: "medium"
explanation: "A lambda function is a small anonymous function defined with the lambda keyword. It can take any number of arguments but can only have one expression. In this code, the lambda function takes an argument x and returns x*2. When invoked with argument 5, it returns 10."
explanationWrong:
  - "The lambda function doubles its input, so 5 becomes 10, not 5."
  - "The lambda function returns the result of the expression, not the lambda object itself."
  - "There is no syntax error in this valid lambda function definition."
---
### Question 22: What will be the output of the following code?
```python
double = lambda x: x * 2
print(double(5))
```
- [ ] 5
- [x] 10
- [ ] <function <lambda> at 0x...>
- [ ] SyntaxError

---
topic: "Datentypen"
subtopic: "Zahlen"
level: "easy"
explanation: "Python has built-in support for complex numbers. They are written with a 'j' or 'J' suffix to indicate the imaginary part. The complex() function can also be used to create a complex number with real and imaginary parts."
explanationWrong:
  - "Complex numbers in Python use 'j' or 'J', not 'i'."
  - "The complex() function requires two arguments: the real and imaginary parts."
  - "Python's built-in support does not require importing a special module for basic complex numbers."
---
### Question 23: Which of the following is a valid way to create a complex number in Python?
- [x] complex(3, 4)
- [ ] 3 + 4i
- [ ] complex(3+4i)
- [ ] 3 + 4j requires importing the math module

---
topic: "Schleifen"
subtopic: "Schleifenkontrolle"
level: "medium"
explanation: "The break statement in a loop is used to exit the loop completely. In this code, when i equals 3, the break statement is executed, and the loop terminates. Therefore, only the numbers 0, 1, and 2 are printed."
explanationWrong:
  - "The loop stops when i equals 3, not after printing 3."
  - "break exits the loop entirely, it doesn't just skip one iteration."
  - "3 is not printed because the loop breaks before the print statement for i=3."
---
### Question 24: What will be the output of the following code?
```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        break
    print(i)
```
- [x] 0

---
topic: "Grundlagen"
subtopic: "Fehlerbehandlung"
level: "medium"
explanation: "In Python, we use try-except blocks to handle exceptions. If an exception occurs in the try block, Python looks for a matching except block to handle it. In this code, division by zero raises a ZeroDivisionError, which is caught by the except block, and 'Error: Division by zero' is printed."
explanationWrong:
  - "The code does not output 0 as it catches the exception before returning a value."
  - "The code does not crash; it handles the exception gracefully."
  - "The code specifically catches ZeroDivisionError, not a generic 'Error' message."
---
### Question 25: What will be the output of the following code?
```python
try:
    result = 10 / 0
    print(result)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error: Division by zero")
```
- [x] Error: Division by zero
- [ ] 0
- [ ] The program crashes with a ZeroDivisionError
- [ ] Error

---
topic: "Datenstrukturen"
subtopic: "Dictionary-Operationen"
level: "medium"
explanation: "The update() method of dictionaries updates the dictionary with elements from another dictionary or from key-value pairs. Existing keys are updated with new values, and new keys are added to the dictionary. In this case, the key 'a' is updated to 10, and the new key 'c' with value 3 is added."
explanationWrong:
  - "update() modifies the original dictionary in-place, not creating a new one."
  - "update() updates existing keys and adds new ones, not just adding new ones."
  - "The update() operation is valid and doesn't raise an error."
---
### Question 26: What will be the output of the following code?
```python
original = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
original.update({'a': 10, 'c': 3})
print(original)
```
- [x] {'a': 10, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
- [ ] {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
- [ ] {'a': 1, 'a': 10, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
- [ ] KeyError

---
topic: "Funktionen"
subtopic: "Rekursion"
level: "medium"
explanation: "Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself. In this factorial function, the base case is when n is 0 or 1, which returns 1. For other values, the function multiplies n by the factorial of (n-1). For n=5, the calculation is 5 * factorial(4), which is 5 * 24 = 120."
explanationWrong:
  - "The factorial of 5 is 5*4*3*2*1 = 120, not 24."
  - "The factorial function returns a specific value, not None."
  - "There is no infinite recursion since there is a base case."
---
### Question 27: What will be the output of the following code?
```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

print(factorial(5))
```
- [ ] 24
- [x] 120
- [ ] None
- [ ] RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded

---
topic: "Datentypen"
subtopic: "Sets"
level: "medium"
explanation: "The intersection() method returns a set containing the common elements of two sets. In this case, set1 and set2 share the elements 3 and 4, so these form the intersection."
explanationWrong:
  - "The intersection includes only common elements (3 and 4), not all elements from both sets."
  - "The intersection is not empty; there are common elements."
  - "The intersection operation returns a set, not a list."
---
### Question 28: What will be the output of the following code?
```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}
print(set1.intersection(set2))
```
- [ ] {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
- [x] {3, 4}
- [ ] set()
- [ ] [3, 4]

---
topic: "Print_Input"
subtopic: "Nutzereingabe"
level: "medium"
explanation: "The input() function in Python always returns a string, regardless of what the user enters. To convert this string to an integer, we need to use the int() function. In this code, user_input = int(input()), which converts the input string to an integer."
explanationWrong:
  - "The input() function returns a string, not an integer."
  - "Python doesn't automatically detect the data type of user input."
  - "A raw input returns a string which must be explicitly converted to an integer."
---
### Question 29: What data type does the input() function return in Python?
- [ ] int
- [x] str
- [ ] Depends on what the user enters
- [ ] float

---
topic: "Schleifen"
subtopic: "For-Schleifen"
level: "medium"
explanation: "A list comprehension provides a concise way to create lists based on existing lists. In this code, [x**2 for x in range(1, 5)] creates a list with the squares of the numbers 1 through 4, which are 1, 4, 9, and 16."
explanationWrong:
  - "The range(1, 5) generates numbers 1 through 4, not 1 through 5."
  - "The expression squares each number, resulting in [1, 4, 9, 16]."
  - "The list comprehension is syntactically correct and doesn't raise an error."
---
### Question 30: What will be the output of the following code?
```python
squared = [x**2 for x in range(1, 5)]
print(squared)
```
- [ ] [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
- [x] [1, 4, 9, 16]
- [ ] [1, 2, 3, 4]
- [ ] SyntaxError

---
topic: "Grundlagen"
subtopic: "Namenskonventionen"
level: "easy"
explanation: "In Python, variable names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores, but they must start with a letter or an underscore. They cannot start with a number. Additionally, they cannot be Python keywords like 'if', 'for', etc."
explanationWrong:
  - "Variable names cannot start with a number in Python."
  - "'if' is a keyword in Python and cannot be used as a variable name."
  - "Variable names cannot contain spaces in Python."
---
### Question 31: Which of the following is a valid variable name in Python?
- [ ] 2ndVariable
- [ ] if
- [x] my_variable
- [ ] my variable

---
topic: "Datenstrukturen"
subtopic: "Listen-Methoden"
level: "easy"
explanation: "The remove() method removes the first occurrence of the specified element from a list. In this code, the first occurrence of 2 is removed from the list [1, 2, 3, 2], resulting in [1, 3, 2]."
explanationWrong:
  - "remove() removes only the first occurrence of the element, not all occurrences."
  - "remove() modifies the list in-place and doesn't return a new list."
  - "Since 2 exists in the list, remove() doesn't raise a ValueError."
---
### Question 32: What will be the output of the following code?
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 2]
numbers.remove(2)
print(numbers)
```
- [ ] [1, 3]
- [x] [1, 3, 2]
- [ ] [1, 2, 3]

explanation: "The pow() function in Python returns the value of x to the power of y. It's equivalent to the expression x**y. In this case, pow(2, 3) calculates 2 raised to the power of 3, which is 8."
explanationWrong:
  - "2^3 is not 6; the correct calculation is 2*2*2 = 8."
  - "pow(2, 3) does not perform 2*3; it calculates 2 raised to the power of 3."
  - "pow(2, 3) is a valid operation and doesn't raise an error."
---
### Question 33: What will be the output of the following code?
```python
result = pow(2, 3)
print(result)
```
- [ ] 6
- [x] 8
- [ ] 5
- [ ] TypeError

explanation: "The split() method in Python splits a string into a list of substrings based on the specified delimiter. If no delimiter is specified, whitespace is used by default. In this case, the string 'Hello World Python' is split at each space, resulting in a list with three elements: ['Hello', 'World', 'Python']."
explanationWrong:
  - "The split() method returns a list of substrings, not a single string."
  - "Without a specific delimiter, split() uses whitespace as the default delimiter."
  - "The split() method doesn't change the original string; it returns a new list."
---
### Question 34: What will be the output of the following code?
```python
text = "Hello World Python"
words = text.split()
print(words)
```
- [ ] "Hello World Python"
- [ ] "Hello"
- [x] ['Hello', 'World', 'Python']
- [ ] TypeError

topic: "Grundlagen"
subtopic: "Typenumwandlung"
level: "easy"
explanation: "In Python, we can convert between different data types using type conversion functions. To convert a string to an integer, we use the int() function. Other type conversion functions include float(), str(), bool(), list(), tuple(), set(), etc."
explanationWrong:
  - "integer() is not a built-in Python function for type conversion."
  - "parse() is not a built-in Python function for type conversion."
  - "cast() is not a built-in Python function for type conversion."
---
### Question 35: Which function is used to convert a string to an integer in Python?
- [x] int()
- [ ] integer()
- [ ] parse()
- [ ] cast()

topic: "Datenstrukturen"
subtopic: "Tupel"
level: "medium"
explanation: "In Python, to create a tuple with a single element, you need to include a trailing comma after the element. Without the comma, Python treats the expression as a grouped expression, not a tuple. In this code, single_tuple = (42,) creates a tuple with one element, and single_tuple = (42) creates just the integer 42."
explanationWrong:
  - "Without a comma, (42) is just the integer 42, not a tuple."
  - "The comma is what makes it a single-element tuple, not the parentheses."
  - "Python doesn't have a special function for creating single-element tuples."
---
### Question 36: What is the correct way to create a tuple with a single element in Python?
- [ ] single_tuple = (42)
- [x] single_tuple = (42,)
- [ ] single_tuple = tuple(42)
- [ ] single_tuple = [42]

---
topic: "Schleifen"
subtopic: "List Comprehension"
level: "medium"
explanation: "List comprehensions in Python can include conditional statements to filter elements. The syntax [x for x in iterable if condition] creates a list of elements from the iterable that satisfy the condition. In this case, [x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0] creates a list of even numbers from 0 to 9."
explanationWrong:
  - "The range(10) generates numbers from 0 to 9, not 1 to 10."
  - "The condition x % 2 == 0 selects even numbers, not odd numbers."
  - "The comprehension is syntactically correct and doesn't raise an error."
---
### Question 37: What will be the output of the following code?
```python
even_numbers = [x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]
print(even_numbers)
```
- [ ] [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
- [x] [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
- [ ] [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
- [ ] SyntaxError

topic: "Print_Input"
subtopic: "Formatierung"
level: "medium"
explanation: "Python's string formatting allows specifying the precision of floating-point numbers. The format specifier :.2f means to format the number as a float with 2 decimal places. In this case, 123.456789 is rounded to 123.46 (note the rounding up from 123.456789)."
explanationWrong:
  - "The format specifier :.2f rounds to 2 decimal places, not truncates."
  - "The format specifier specifies the number of decimal places, not the total number of digits."
  - "The string format is valid and doesn't raise an error."
---
### Question 38: What will be the output of the following code?
```python
number = 123.456789
print("{:.2f}".format(number))
```
- [ ] 123.45
- [x] 123.46
- [ ] 123.4
- [ ] ValueError

topic: "Funktionen"
subtopic: "Benannte Parameter"
level: "medium"
explanation: "In Python, keyword arguments (or named parameters) allow you to specify function arguments by their parameter names. This makes the code more readable and allows you to skip default parameters. In this code, the function is called with keyword arguments in a different order than the parameter definition, but Python correctly matches them by name."
explanationWrong:
  - "With keyword arguments, the order doesn't matter as long as the names match."
  - "The function correctly receives the parameters and returns 'Hello, Bob! You are 30 years old.'"
  - "The function call with keyword arguments is valid and doesn't raise an error."
---
### Question 39: What will be the output of the following code?
```python
def greet(name, age):
    return f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old."

print(greet(age=30, name="Bob"))
```
- [x] Hello, Bob! You are 30 years old.
- [ ] Hello, 30! You are Bob years old.
- [ ] TypeError: greet() got an unexpected keyword argument
- [ ] SyntaxError: positional argument follows keyword argument

topic: "Datentypen"
subtopic: "String-Indizierung"
level: "easy"
explanation: "In Python, negative indices are used to count from the end of the sequence. The index -1 refers to the last element, -2 to the second-to-last, and so on. In this case, text[-1] returns the last character of the string 'Python', which is 'n'."
explanationWrong:
  - "The negative index -1 refers to the last character, not the first."
  - "The negative index -1 returns 'n', not 'Python' in reverse."
  - "The index is valid and doesn't raise an error."
---
### Question 40: What will be the output of the following code?
```python
text = "Python"
print(text[-1])
```
- [ ] P
- [x] n
- [ ] nohtyP
- [ ] IndexError

explanation: "Keywords in Python are reserved words that cannot be used as variable names, function names, or any other identifiers. Some common Python keywords include 'if', 'else', 'while', 'for', 'def', 'class', etc. Of the options listed, only 'global' is a Python keyword."
explanationWrong:
  - "Function is not a Python keyword; it can be used as an identifier."
  - "Print is not a keyword in Python 3; it's a built-in function."
  - "Value is not a Python keyword; it can be used as an identifier."

### Question 41: Which of the following is a Python keyword?
- [ ] function
- [ ] print
- [x] global
- [ ] value

topic: "Datenstrukturen"
subtopic: "Listen vs. Tupel"
level: "easy"
explanation: "The main difference between lists and tuples in Python is mutability. Lists are mutable, which means they can be changed after creation (elements can be added, removed, or modified). Tuples are immutable, which means they cannot be changed after creation."
explanationWrong:
  - "Both lists and tuples can store elements of different data types."
  - "Both lists and tuples maintain the order of elements."
  - "Both lists and tuples can be accessed by index."
---
### Question 42: What is the main difference between lists and tuples in Python?
- [x] Lists are mutable, while tuples are immutable
- [ ] Lists can store different data types, while tuples cannot
- [ ] Lists maintain the order of elements, while tuples do not
- [ ] Lists can be accessed by index, while tuples cannot

---
topic: "Funktionen"
subtopic: "Default-Parameter"
level: "medium"
explanation: "In Python functions, default parameter values are evaluated only once at function definition time, not each time the function is called. This means that if the default value is a mutable object like a list, and it's modified inside the function, the modifications will persist across function calls. In this code, the empty list default value is created once and modified in each call."
explanationWrong:
  - "The default empty list is shared between calls, not created anew each time."
  - "With each call, 42 is appended to the same list, resulting in [42, 42] after two calls."
  - "The behavior is expected in Python, not a syntax error."
---
### Question 43: What will be the output of the following code?
```python
def append_to(element, to=[]):
    to.append(element)
    return to

print(append_to(42))
print(append_to(42))
```
- [ ] [42]

topic: "Schleifen"
subtopic: "Schleifenkombination"
level: "medium"
explanation: "This code uses nested loops to iterate through both lists. For each element in list1, it iterates through all elements in list2, resulting in all possible combinations. The combinations are then filtered to include only those where the sum is 8."
explanationWrong:
  - "The code selects pairs whose sum is 8, not just the pairs (3, 5) and (5, 3)."
  - "The correct combinations with a sum of 8 are (3, 5) and (5, 3)."
  - "The list comprehension is valid and doesn't raise a syntax error."
---
### Question 44: What will be the output of the following code?
```python
list1 = [1, 3, 5]
list2 = [2, 4, 5]
result = [(x, y) for x in list1 for y in list2 if x + y == 8]
print(result)
```
- [ ] [(3, 5), (5, 3)]

topic: "Datentypen"
subtopic: "Boolesche Werte"
level: "easy"
explanation: "In Python, uppercase 'True' and 'False' are boolean literals. The lowercase versions 'true' and 'false' are not recognized as boolean values; they would be treated as variable names. Similarly, 'yes' and 'no' are not boolean literals in Python."
explanationWrong:
  - "true (lowercase) is not a boolean literal in Python."
  - "yes is not a boolean literal in Python."
  - "no is not a boolean literal in Python."
---
### Question 45: Which of the following represents a boolean value in Python?
- [x] True
- [ ] true
- [ ] yes
- [ ] no

topic: "Print_Input"
subtopic: "Ausgabe-Formatierung"
level: "medium"
explanation: "In Python's print function, the 'end' parameter specifies what to print at the end of the provided value. By default, it's a newline character ('\\n'). In this code, end='-' replaces the default newline with a hyphen, causing the numbers to be printed on the same line separated by hyphens."
explanationWrong:
  - "The end parameter changes the separator to a hyphen, not a space."
  - "The numbers are printed on the same line with hyphens, not on separate lines."
  - "The print function with the end parameter is valid and doesn't raise an error."
---
### Question 46: What will be the output of the following code?
```python
for i in range(1, 4):
    print(i, end='-')
```
- [ ] 1 2 3
- [x] 1-2-3-
- [ ] 1

level: "easy"
explanation: "Triple quotes (''' or \"\"\") in Python allow string literals to span multiple lines. This is useful for writing long strings or multi-line content like documentation strings (docstrings). The newlines and formatting in the triple-quoted string are preserved in the output."
explanationWrong:
  - "Single quotes can't span multiple lines without escaping the newline."
  - "Double quotes can't span multiple lines without escaping the newline."
  - "There's no specific multi_line() function in Python for this purpose."
---
### Question 47: What is the correct way to write a multi-line string in Python?
- [ ] 'This is a
multi-line string'
- [ ] "This is a
multi-line string"
- [x] """This is a
multi-line string"""
- [ ] multi_line("This is a
multi-line string")

topic: "Datenstrukturen"
subtopic: "Sets"
level: "medium"
explanation: "The union() method returns a set containing all elements from both sets. In this case, the union of {1, 2, 3} and {3, 4, 5} is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Note that duplicate elements (like 3) appear only once in the result, as sets only contain unique elements."
explanationWrong:
  - "The union includes all unique elements from both sets, not just the common ones."
  - "Duplicate elements appear only once in the result, not twice."
  - "The union operation returns a set, not a list."
---
### Question 48: What will be the output of the following code?
```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {3, 4, 5}
print(set1.union(set2))
```
- [x] {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

topic: "Funktionen"
subtopic: "Scope"
level: "medium"
explanation: "In Python, a variable defined inside a function is in the local scope and is not accessible outside the function. When the function test() is called, it creates a local variable x with a value of 20. This local variable is destroyed when the function returns. The print statement outside the function tries to access a variable x that doesn't exist in the global scope, resulting in a NameError."
explanationWrong:
  - "Variables defined inside a function are not automatically available outside."
  - "The assignment inside the function doesn't affect any global variable."
  - "The error is raised because x is not defined in the global scope, not because of a syntax issue."
---
### Question 49: What will happen when the following code is executed?
```python
def test():
    x = 20
    print("Inside function:", x)

test()
print("Outside function:", x)
```
- [ ] Inside function: 20
Outside function: 20
- [ ] Inside function: 20
Outside function: None
- [x] It will raise a NameError because x is not defined outside the function
- [ ] SyntaxError

topic: "Grundlagen"
subtopic: "Wertgleichheit vs. IdentitÃ¤t"
level: "medium"
explanation: "In Python, the == operator checks if two values are equal, while the is operator checks if two variables refer to the same object in memory. For immutable objects like strings, Python often optimizes by reusing objects for the same value, but this is not guaranteed for all cases, especially for strings created in different ways or for mutable objects."
explanationWrong:
  - "The == operator checks value equality, not object identity."
  - "The is operator checks object identity, not value equality."
  - "= is the assignment operator, not a comparison operator."
---
### Question 50: What is the difference between the '==' operator and the 'is' operator in Python?
- [x] '==' checks if two values are equal, while 'is' checks if two variables refer to the same object in memory
- [ ] '==' checks if two variables refer to the same object, while 'is' checks if two values are equal
- [ ] '==' is used for assignment, while 'is' is used for comparison
- [ ] There is no difference; they can be used interchangeably
