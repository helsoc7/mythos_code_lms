topic: "Grundlagen"
subtopic: "Variablenzuweisungen"
level: "easy"
explanation: "In Python, multiple assignments can be made in a single line using tuple unpacking. The expression 'a, b, c = 5, 10, 15' assigns 5 to a, 10 to b, and 15 to c."
explanationWrong:
  - "Python allows multiple assignments in a single line using tuple unpacking."
  - "The values are assigned in order from left to right."
  - "No error occurs as the number of variables matches the number of values."
---
### Question 1: What will be the values of a, b, and c after executing the following code?
```python
a, b, c = 5, 10, 15
```
- [x] a=5, b=10, c=15
- [ ] a=15, b=10, c=5
- [ ] a=b=c=5
- [ ] SyntaxError

topic: "Datentypen"
subtopic: "String-Indexierung"
level: "medium"
explanation: "In Python strings, negative indices count from the end of the string. The index -1 refers to the last character, -2 to the second-to-last, and so on. In 'Python', the character at index -3 is 'h'."
explanationWrong:
  - "The negative index -3 counts from the end, giving the third-to-last character."
  - "For 'Python', the character at index -3 is 'h', not 't' or 'o'."
  - "Negative indices are valid in Python and don't cause an error."
---
### Question 2: What will be the output of the following code?
```python
s = "Python"
print(s[-3])
```
- [ ] P
- [ ] t
- [x] h
- [ ] IndexError

---
topic: "Funktionen"
subtopic: "Funktionsaufrufe"
level: "medium"
explanation: "In Python, functions are called by adding parentheses after the function name, with any required arguments inside the parentheses. Without the parentheses, you're just referring to the function object itself, not calling it. In this code, 'print(greet)' prints the function object, and 'print(greet())' calls the function and prints its return value."
explanationWrong:
  - "Without parentheses, the function is not called, and the function object is printed."
  - "The function returns the string 'Hello, World!', which is printed by the second print statement."
  - "Both statements are syntactically correct and don't cause errors."
---
### Question 3: What will be the output of the following code?
```python
def greet():
    return "Hello, World!"

print(greet)
print(greet())
```
- [ ] Hello, World!
Hello, World!
- [x] <function greet at 0x...>
Hello, World!
- [ ] None
Hello, World!
- [ ] TypeError

---
topic: "Datenstrukturen"
subtopic: "Listen-Multiplikation"
level: "medium"
explanation: "In Python, multiplying a list by an integer n creates a new list with the original list's contents repeated n times. In this case, [1, 2, 3] * 2 creates a new list [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]."
explanationWrong:
  - "List multiplication repeats the elements, not multiplies their values."
  - "The elements are repeated in their original order, not interleaved."
  - "The operation is valid and doesn't cause an error."
---
### Question 4: What will be the output of the following code?
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3] * 2
print(numbers)
```
- [x] [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
- [ ] [2, 4, 6]
- [ ] [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]
- [ ] TypeError

---
topic: "Schleifen"
subtopic: "Enumerate-Funktion"
level: "medium"
explanation: "The enumerate() function in Python adds a counter to an iterable and returns it as an enumerate object. It's commonly used in for loops when you need both the index and the value. In this code, enumerate(fruits) provides pairs of (index, value) for each element in the fruits list."
explanationWrong:
  - "enumerate() provides both index and value for each element in the iterable."
  - "The index starts at 0 by default, not 1."
  - "The function is correctly used and doesn't cause an error."
---
### Question 5: What will be the output of the following code?
```python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
for i, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
    print(i, fruit)
```
- [x] 0 apple
1 banana
2 cherry
- [ ] 1 apple
2 banana
3 cherry
- [ ] apple 0
banana 1
cherry 2
- [ ] ValueError

---
topic: "Print_Input"
subtopic: "Formatierte-Strings"
level: "medium"
explanation: "In Python 3.6+, f-strings provide an easy way to embed expressions inside string literals. The expressions are evaluated at runtime and formatted according to format specifiers. In 'f\"{name} is {age} years old\"', the variables name and age are substituted with their values."
explanationWrong:
  - "f-strings substitute variable names with their values at runtime."
  - "The variables must be defined before using them in an f-string."
  - "The syntax is valid and doesn't cause an error."
---
### Question 6: What will be the output of the following code?
```python
name = 'Alice'
age = 30
print(f"{name} is {age} years old")
```
- [x] Alice is 30 years old
- [ ] {name} is {age} years old
- [ ] name is age years old
- [ ] SyntaxError

---
topic: "Grundlagen"
subtopic: "Wahrheitswerte"
level: "medium"
explanation: "In Python, 'and' is a logical operator that returns the first false value encountered, or the last value if all are true. In the expression '0 and 1', 0 is considered false, so the expression returns 0 without evaluating 1."
explanationWrong:
  - "In logical contexts, 0 is considered false in Python."
  - "The 'and' operator returns the first false value, not a boolean False."
  - "The expression is correctly formed and doesn't cause an error."
---
### Question 7: What will be the output of the following code?
```python
result = 0 and 1
print(result)
```
- [ ] True
- [ ] False
- [x] 0
- [ ] 1

---
topic: "Datentypen"
subtopic: "String-Methoden"
level: "medium"
explanation: "The join() method in Python takes an iterable of strings and joins them using the string on which the method is called as a separator. In this case, '-'.join(['a', 'b', 'c']) joins the strings 'a', 'b', and 'c' with '-' as the separator, resulting in 'a-b-c'."
explanationWrong:
  - "The join() method uses the string it's called on as the separator between elements."
  - "The elements must be strings or convertible to strings."
  - "The method is correctly used and doesn't cause an error."
---
### Question 8: What will be the output of the following code?
```python
result = '-'.join(['a', 'b', 'c'])
print(result)
```
- [ ] ['a', 'b', 'c']
- [x] a-b-c
- [ ] a b c
- [ ] TypeError

---
topic: "Funktionen"
subtopic: "Map-Funktion"
level: "medium"
explanation: "The map() function in Python applies a given function to each item in an iterable and returns an iterator of the results. In this code, map(len, ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']) applies the len() function to each string in the list, returning an iterator of their lengths. The list() function then converts this iterator to a list."
explanationWrong:
  - "map() applies the function to each element, returning an iterator of the results."
  - "The len() function returns the length of each string."
  - "The function and conversion are correctly used and don't cause an error."
---
### Question 9: What will be the output of the following code?
```python
lengths = list(map(len, ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']))
print(lengths)
```
- [x] [5, 6, 6]
- [ ] ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
- [ ] [1, 1, 1]
- [ ] TypeError

---
topic: "Datenstrukturen"
subtopic: "Dictionary-Comprehension"
level: "medium"
explanation: "A dictionary comprehension creates a dictionary from an iterable using a key-value pattern. In this code, {x: x**2 for x in range(4)} creates a dictionary where each number from 0 to 3 is a key, and its square is the corresponding value."
explanationWrong:
  - "The comprehension creates a dictionary with keys 0, 1, 2, 3 and their squares as values."
  - "Dictionary comprehensions use the format {key: value for item in iterable}."
  - "The syntax is valid and doesn't cause an error."
---
### Question 10: What will be the output of the following code?
```python
squares = {x: x**2 for x in range(4)}
print(squares)
```
- [x] {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9}
- [ ] [0, 1, 4, 9]
- [ ] {0, 1, 4, 9}
- [ ] SyntaxError

---
topic: "Grundlagen"
subtopic: "Mathematische-Operatoren"
level: "easy"
explanation: "The exponentiation operator ** in Python raises a number to a power. In this case, 2**3 calculates 2 raised to the power of the power of 3, which is 2 * 2 * 2 = 8."
explanationWrong:
  - "2**3 means 2 raised to the power of 3, not 2 * 3."
  - "The result is 8, not 6 or 9."
  - "The operation is valid and doesn't cause an error."
---
### Question 11: What is the value of the expression 2**3 in Python?
- [ ] 6
- [x] 8
- [ ] 9
- [ ] SyntaxError

---
topic: "Datentypen"
subtopic: "String-Methoden"
level: "medium"
explanation: "The startswith() method in Python checks if a string starts with the specified prefix. It returns True if the string starts with the prefix, and False otherwise. In this case, 'Hello'.startswith('He') returns True because 'Hello' does indeed start with 'He'."
explanationWrong:
  - "The startswith() method checks if the string begins with the specified prefix."
  - "The method is case-sensitive, so 'Hello'.startswith('He') is True."
  - "The method is correctly used and doesn't cause an error."
---
### Question 12: What will be the output of the following code?
```python
text = "Hello"
print(text.startswith('He'))
```
- [x] True
- [ ] False
- [ ] 'He'
- [ ] AttributeError

---
topic: "Schleifen"
subtopic: "List-Comprehension"
level: "medium"
explanation: "A list comprehension with a condition creates a list from an iterable, including only the elements that satisfy the condition. In this code, [x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0] creates a list of even numbers from 0 to 9."
explanationWrong:
  - "The condition selects numbers where x % 2 == 0, which are even numbers."
  - "range(10) generates numbers from 0 to 9, not 1 to 10."
  - "The comprehension is correctly formed and doesn't cause an error."
---
### Question 13: What will be the output of the following code?
```python
even = [x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]
print(even)
```
- [ ] [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
- [x] [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
- [ ] [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
- [ ] SyntaxError

---
topic: "Funktionen"
subtopic: "Kwargs-Parameter"
level: "medium"
explanation: "In Python, **kwargs in a function definition allows the function to accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. These are collected into a dictionary where the parameter names are the keys and the arguments are the values. In this code, **kwargs collects the keyword arguments into a dictionary {'a': 1, 'b': 2}."
explanationWrong:
  - "**kwargs collects keyword arguments into a dictionary."
  - "The function correctly prints the kwargs dictionary."
  - "The syntax is valid and doesn't cause an error."
---
### Question 14: What will be the output of the following code?
```python
def print_kwargs(**kwargs):
    print(kwargs)

print_kwargs(a=1, b=2)
```
- [x] {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
- [ ] {'kwargs': {'a': 1, 'b': 2}}
- [ ] [('a', 1), ('b', 2)]
- [ ] TypeError

---
topic: "Print_Input"
subtopic: "Eingabe-Konvertierung"
level: "easy"
explanation: "The input() function in Python always returns a string, regardless of what the user enters. To convert this string to a number, you need to use functions like int() or float(). In this code, the input is treated as a string, so '5' * 3 repeats the string '5' three times, resulting in '555'."
explanationWrong:
  - "input() returns a string, not a number, so '5' * 3 is string repetition, not multiplication."
  - "String repetition with * repeats the string the specified number of times."
  - "The code is valid and doesn't cause an error."
---
### Question 15: What will be the output of the following code if the user enters 5?
```python
user_input = input("Enter a number: ")
result = user_input * 3
print(result)
```
- [ ] 15
- [x] 555
- [ ] 8
- [ ] TypeError

---
topic: "Datenstrukturen"
subtopic: "Set-Methoden"
level: "medium"
explanation: "The add() method adds an element to a set if it's not already present. Since sets only contain unique elements, adding a duplicate has no effect. In this code, the numbers set initially contains {1, 2, 3}, and after adding 2 (which is already present) and then 4, it contains {1, 2, 3, 4}."
explanationWrong:
  - "Sets only contain unique elements, so adding 2 again has no effect."
  - "The add() method modifies the set in place, not creating a new one."
  - "The operations are valid and don't cause an error."
---
### Question 16: What will be the output of the following code?
```python
numbers = {1, 2, 3}
numbers.add(2)
numbers.add(4)
print(numbers)
```
- [ ] {1, 2, 3, 2, 4}
- [x] {1, 2, 3, 4}
- [ ] {1, 2, 3}
- [ ] TypeError

---
topic: "Grundlagen"
subtopic: "Ausnahmebehandlung"
level: "medium"
explanation: "In Python, try-except blocks are used to handle exceptions. If an exception occurs in a try block, the corresponding except block is executed. In this code, trying to divide by zero raises a ZeroDivisionError, which is caught by the except block, and 'Cannot divide by zero' is printed."
explanationWrong:
  - "Division by zero raises a ZeroDivisionError in Python."
  - "The except block catches the ZeroDivisionError and executes its code."
  - "The try-except structure is valid and properly handles the error."
---
### Question 17: What will be the output of the following code?
```python
try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero")
```
- [x] Cannot divide by zero
- [ ] None
- [ ] ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
- [ ] SyntaxError

---
topic: "Datentypen"
subtopic: "String-Formatierung"
level: "medium"
explanation: "In the format() method, you can refer to the arguments by position or by name. In this code, 'Hello, {0}. You are {1} years old.'.format('Alice', 30) replaces {0} with the first argument ('Alice') and {1} with the second argument (30)."
explanationWrong:
  - "The {0} and {1} placeholders are replaced with the corresponding arguments."
  - "The format() method substitutes the placeholders with the provided values."
  - "The method is correctly used and doesn't cause an error."
---
### Question 18: What will be the output of the following code?
```python
message = "Hello, {0}. You are {1} years old.".format("Alice", 30)
print(message)
```
- [x] Hello, Alice. You are 30 years old.
- [ ] Hello, {0}. You are {1} years old.
- [ ] Hello, . You are  years old.
- [ ] ValueError

---
topic: "Funktionen"
subtopic: "Funktionsparameter"
level: "medium"
explanation: "In Python functions, default parameter values are evaluated only once, when the function is defined. If the default value is a mutable object like a list, and it's modified inside the function, the modifications persist across function calls. In this code, the default empty list is created once and shared between all calls to add_item()."
explanationWrong:
  - "The default list is created once at function definition time, not for each call."
  - "Each call to add_item() modifies the same default list object."
  - "This behavior is a common source of bugs but is not a syntax error."
---
### Question 19: What will be the output of the following code?
```python
def add_item(item, items=[]):
    items.append(item)
    return items

print(add_item('apple'))
print(add_item('banana'))
```
- [ ] ['apple']
['banana']
- [x] ['apple']
['apple', 'banana']
- [ ] ['apple', 'banana']
['apple', 'banana']
- [ ] SyntaxError

---
topic: "Datenstrukturen"
subtopic: "Tupel-Unpacking"
level: "medium"
explanation: "In Python, you can use tuple unpacking to swap variables without using a temporary variable. The expression 'a, b = b, a' creates a tuple (b, a) on the right side, and then unpacks it into the variables a and b on the left side, effectively swapping their values."
explanationWrong:
  - "This is tuple unpacking, which swaps the values of a and b."
  - "After execution, a will be 10 and b will be 5."
  - "The operation is valid and doesn't cause an error."
---
### Question 20: What will be the values of a and b after executing the following code?
```python
a = 5
b = 10
a, b = b, a
```
- [ ] a=5, b=10
- [x] a=10, b=5
- [ ] a=b=10
- [ ] SyntaxError

---
topic: "Schleifen"
subtopic: "While-Schleife"
level: "medium"
explanation: "In Python, a while loop continues as long as its condition is true. In this code, the loop runs as long as n > 0. In each iteration, n is divided by 2 using integer division (//) and count is incremented. Starting with n = 8, the sequence is: 8→4→2→1→0, at which point the loop stops. So count is incremented 4 times."
explanationWrong:
  - "The loop runs until n becomes 0, which takes 4 iterations from n=8."
  - "The sequence of n values is: 8, 4, 2, 1, 0, with the loop stopping at 0."
  - "The code is valid and doesn't cause an infinite loop or error."
---
### Question 21: What will be the output of the following code?
```python
n = 8
count = 0
while n > 0:
    n = n // 2
    count += 1
print(count)
```
- [ ] 3
- [x] 4
- [ ] 8
- [ ] The loop runs indefinitely

---
topic: "Datentypen"
subtopic: "Listen-Methoden"
level: "medium"
explanation: "The sort() method in Python sorts a list in place (modifies the original list). By default, it sorts in ascending order. In this code, numbers.sort() sorts the list [3, 1, 4, 1, 5] to become [1, 1, 3, 4, 5]."
explanationWrong:
  - "sort() modifies the list in place, sorting it in ascending order by default."
  - "After sorting, the list becomes [1, 1, 3, 4, 5]."
  - "The method is correctly used and doesn't cause an error."
---
### Question 22: What will be the output of the following code?
```python
numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5]
numbers.sort()
print(numbers)
```
- [x] [1, 1, 3, 4, 5]
- [ ] [5, 4, 3, 1, 1]
- [ ] [3, 1, 4, 1, 5]
- [ ] None

---
topic: "Print_Input"
subtopic: "Escape-Sequenzen"
level: "easy"
explanation: "In Python strings, the escape sequence \\t represents a tab character. When printed, it aligns the text to the next tab stop. In this case, 'Hello\\tWorld' prints 'Hello' followed by a tab, and then 'World'."
explanationWrong:
  - "\\t is the escape sequence for a tab character, not literal characters."
  - "The tab character creates horizontal spacing, not a newline."
  - "The string is correctly formatted and doesn't cause an error."
---
### Question 23: What will be the output of the following code?
```python
print("Hello\tWorld")
```
- [ ] Hello\tWorld
- [x] Hello    World
- [ ] Hello
World
- [ ] SyntaxError

---
topic: "Grundlagen"
subtopic: "Wahrheitswerte"
level: "medium"
explanation: "In Python, 'or' is a logical operator that returns the first true value encountered, or the last value if all are false. In the expression '\"\" or 0 or []', all values are considered false in a boolean context, so the last value ([]) is returned."
explanationWrong:
  - "All values in the expression are falsy in Python."
  - "The 'or' operator returns the last value when all are falsy."
  - "The expression is correctly formed and doesn't cause an error."
---
### Question 24: What will be the output of the following code?
```python
result = "" or 0 or []
print(result)
```
- [ ] ""
- [ ] 0
- [x] []
- [ ] False

---
topic: "Funktionen"
subtopic: "Globale-Variablen"
level: "medium"
explanation: "In Python, to modify a global variable from within a function, you need to use the 'global' keyword. Without it, assigning to a variable inside a function creates a new local variable, leaving the global variable unchanged. In this code, the x inside modify_global() is a local variable that shadows the global x, so the global x remains 10."
explanationWrong:
  - "Without the 'global' keyword, the x inside the function is a new local variable."
  - "The assignment inside the function doesn't affect the global x."
  - "The code is valid and doesn't cause an error."
---
### Question 25: What will be the output of the following code?
```python
x = 10

def modify_global():
    x = 20
    print("Inside function:", x)

modify_global()
print("Outside function:", x)
```
- [ ] Inside function: 10
Outside function: 10
- [x] Inside function: 20
Outside function: 10
- [ ] Inside function: 20
Outside function: 20
- [ ] NameError

---
topic: "Datenstrukturen"
subtopic: "Dictionary-Methoden"
level: "medium"
explanation: "The get() method of a dictionary returns the value for a specified key if the key exists, or a default value (which defaults to None) if it doesn't. In this code, fruit_counts.get('apple', 0) returns the value for 'apple' if it exists, or 0 if not. Since 'apple' is not in the dictionary, it returns 0."
explanationWrong:
  - "get() returns the default value (0) when the key is not in the dictionary."
  - "The method doesn't add the key to the dictionary, it just returns the default."
  - "The method is correctly used and doesn't cause an error."
---
### Question 26: What will be the output of the following code?
```python
fruit_counts = {'banana': 3, 'orange': 2}
print(fruit_counts.get('apple', 0))
```
- [ ] None
- [x] 0
- [ ] KeyError
- [ ] 'apple'

---
topic: "Schleifen"
subtopic: "Break-Statement"
level: "medium"
explanation: "The break statement in Python terminates the loop containing it. Once the break statement is executed, program control passes to the statement immediately following the loop. In this code, when 'b' is encountered in the string 'banana', the inner loop breaks, but the outer loop continues with the next character, so 'a', 'b', 'n', 'a', 'n', 'a' are each printed once."
explanationWrong:
  - "The break statement only affects the innermost loop containing it."
  - "Each character in 'banana' starts an inner loop, which immediately breaks for the first occurrence."
  - "The code is valid and correctly prints each character once."
---
### Question 27: What will be the output of the following code?
```python
for char in "banana":
    for i in range(3):
        print(char)

topic: "Datentypen"
subtopic: "Zahlenumwandlung"
level: "easy"
explanation: "The int() function in Python converts a string or number to an integer. When converting a string with a different base, you can specify the base as a second argument. In this code, int('1010', 2) converts the binary string '1010' to its decimal equivalent, which is 10."
explanationWrong:
  - "The second argument to int() specifies the base of the string representation."
  - "The binary string '1010' corresponds to the decimal number 10."
  - "The function is correctly used and doesn't cause an error."
---
### Question 28: What will be the output of the following code?
```python
result = int('1010', 2)
print(result)
```
- [ ] 1010
- [x] 10
- [ ] 5
- [ ] ValueError

---
topic: "Grundlagen"
subtopic: "Operatoren"
level: "medium"
explanation: "The 'is' operator in Python checks if two variables refer to the same object in memory (identity check), while the '==' operator checks if two variables have the same value (equality check). Small integers are cached in Python, so a and b refer to the same object. However, larger integers like 1000 might not be cached, so c and d might be distinct objects with the same value."
explanationWrong:
  - "For small integers, Python caches the objects, so a is b is True."
  - "The == operator checks value equality, not object identity, so c == d is True."
  - "The code is valid and correctly demonstrates the difference between 'is' and '=='."
---
### Question 29: What will be the outputs of the following code?
```python
a = 5
b = 5
print(a is b)

c = 1000
d = 1000
print(c == d)
```
- [x] True
True
- [ ] False
False
- [ ] True
False
- [ ] False
True

topic: "Print_Input"
subtopic: "Formatierte-Ausgabe"
level: "medium"
explanation: "The format() method in Python allows formatting of output with specific precision. The format specifier .2f indicates to format the number as a float with 2 decimal places. In this code, '{:.2f}'.format(3.14159) formats the number to 2 decimal places, resulting in '3.14'."
explanationWrong:
  - "The .2f format specifier rounds to 2 decimal places, not truncates."
  - "The formatted output is '3.14', with the number rounded."
  - "The method is correctly used and doesn't cause an error."
---
### Question 30: What will be the output of the following code?
```python
pi = 3.14159
print("{:.2f}".format(pi))
```
- [ ] 3.14159
- [x] 3.14
- [ ] 3.142
- [ ] ValueError

---
topic: "Funktionen"
subtopic: "Dokumentations-Strings"

explanation: "In Python, the __doc__ attribute of a function returns its docstring, which is the string literal specified in the function definition. It's used by the help() function to generate documentation. In this code, print(greet.__doc__) outputs the docstring of the greet() function."
explanationWrong:
  - "The __doc__ attribute returns the function's docstring."
  - "Docstrings are defined as string literals at the beginning of the function body."
  - "The attribute is correctly accessed and doesn't cause an error."

subtopic: "Listen-Slicing"
level: "medium"
explanation: "List slicing in Python follows the format list[start:stop:step]. The slice [::-1] uses a step of -1, which reverses the list. In this code, numbers[::-1] returns a new list with the elements of numbers in reverse order."
explanationWrong:
  - "The slice [::-1] reverses the list, not just accesses the last element."
  - "A new reversed list is returned, not a single element."
  - "The slicing operation is valid and doesn't cause an error."

explanation: "When iterating over a dictionary using a for loop without any method, you iterate through its keys. In this code, `for item in student` iterates through the keys of the `student` dictionary, printing each key ('name', 'age', 'grade')."
explanationWrong:
  - "Iterating over a dictionary directly gives its keys, not its values or key-value pairs."
  - "The output is the sequence of keys in the dictionary."
  - "The iteration is valid and doesn't cause an error."

explanation: "The augmented assignment operator += in Python adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand. It's a shorthand for x = x + y. In this code, x += 5 adds 5 to the current value of x (10), resulting in x = 15."
explanationWrong:
  - "The += operator adds the right operand to the left operand."
  - "After x += 5, the value of x becomes 15, not 5 or 50."
  - "The operation is valid and doesn't cause an error."
---
### Question 34: What will be the value of x after executing the following code?
```python
x = 10
x += 5

subtopic: "Boolsche-Operatoren"
level: "medium"
explanation: "In Python, when comparing multiple values with comparison operators like <, the comparisons are chained together. The expression 1 < 2 < 3 is equivalent to 1 < 2 and 2 < 3, which is True. Similarly, 5 > 3 > 1 is equivalent to 5 > 3 and 3 > 1, which is also True."
explanationWrong:
  - "Comparison chaining in Python works left-to-right and is evaluated as expected."
  - "The expression 1 < 2 < 3 is True because each comparison is true."
  - "The expression 5 > 3 > 1 is True because each comparison is true."

explanation: "In Python, a function defined inside another function is called a nested function. It has access to the outer function's variables. In this code, the inner function printer() has access to the variable message from the outer function outer(). When printer() is called, it prints the value of message ('Hello')."
explanationWrong:
  - "Nested functions have access to the variables of their containing functions."
  - "The inner function correctly prints the message variable from the outer function."

explanation: "Python's string format method can align text using format specifiers. The specifier '>10' right-aligns the text in a field of width 10. In this code, each name is right-aligned in a field of width 10, with spaces used for padding on the left."
explanationWrong:
  - "The >10 format specifier right-aligns the text in a field of width 10."
  - "The names are padded with spaces on the left to reach the specified width."
  - "The formatting is correctly applied and doesn't cause an error."

explanation: "The intersection operator & in Python returns a set containing elements that are common to both sets. In this code, {1, 2, 3} & {2, 3, 4} returns the set {2, 3}, which are the elements present in both sets."
explanationWrong:
  - "The & operator returns the intersection of the sets, not their union."
  - "The intersection contains only elements present in both sets."
  - "The operation is valid and doesn't cause an error."

topic: "Funktionen"
subtopic: "First-Class-Functions"
level: "medium"
explanation: "In Python, functions are first-class objects, which means they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions. In this code, the multiply function is assigned to the variable double, and then double is called with argument 5, which is equivalent to calling multiply(2, 5)."
explanationWrong:
  - "Functions in Python can be assigned to variables and then called through those variables."
  - "When double(5) is called, it effectively calls multiply(2, 5), resulting in 10."
  - "The function assignment and call are valid and don't cause an error."

### Question 39: What will be the output of the following code?
```python
def multiply(a, b):

explanation: "Operator precedence in Python determines which operators are evaluated first. The not operator has higher precedence than and, which has higher precedence than or. In this expression, not True is evaluated first (giving False), then False and False is evaluated (giving False), and finally False or True is evaluated (giving True)."
explanationWrong:
  - "The not operator has higher precedence than and and or."
  - "The expression is evaluated according to operator precedence rules."
  - "The final result is True because False or True evaluates to True."

explanation: "In Python, multiplying a string by an integer n creates a new string that consists of the original string repeated n times. In this code, '*' * 5 creates a string with 5 asterisks: '*****'."
explanationWrong:
  - "String multiplication repeats the string the specified number of times."
  - "The result is a single string with the character repeated, not a list."

topic: "Schleifen"
subtopic: "Do-while-Simulation"
level: "medium"
explanation: "Python doesn't have a dedicated do-while loop, but it can be simulated using a while True loop with a break statement. In this code, the loop executes at least once, and then continues as long as the condition (n > 0) is true. The sequence of n values is: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, with the loop breaking when n becomes 0. So n takes 6 different values during the loop."
explanationWrong:
  - "The loop runs until n becomes 0, which takes 6 iterations from n=5."
  - "The loop structure with while True and break simulates a do-while loop."
  - "The code is valid and correctly counts the iterations."
---
### Question 42: How many different values does n take during the execution of the following code?
```python
n = 5
count = 0
while True:
    count += 1
    n -= 1
    if n < 0:
        break

explanation: "In Python, lists can be concatenated using the + operator. This creates a new list that contains all the elements from the first list followed by all the elements from the second list. In this code, [1, 2, 3] + [4, 5] creates a new list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]."
explanationWrong:
  - "List concatenation with + joins the elements of both lists in order."
  - "The result is a new list containing all elements from both original lists."
  - "The operation is valid and doesn't cause an error."

explanation: "In Python, a lambda function is an anonymous function defined with the lambda keyword. It can have any number of arguments but can only have one expression. In this code, the lambda function takes an argument n and returns n squared, so for n=3, it returns 9."
explanationWrong:
  - "The lambda function calculates the square of its argument."
  - "For the argument 3, it returns 3^2 = 9."
  - "The function is correctly defined and doesn't cause an error."

topic: "Print_Input"
subtopic: "Zeilenumbruch"
level: "easy"
explanation: "By default, the print() function in Python adds a newline character at the end of the printed string. However, you can change this by specifying a different end parameter. In this code, end='' (an empty string) means no character is added at the end, so the next print starts immediately after the current one, resulting in 'HelloWorld' on a single line."
explanationWrong:
  - "Setting end='' removes the default newline at the end of print()."
  - "This causes the output of consecutive print statements to appear on the same line."
  - "The parameter usage is valid and correctly modifies the output."
---
### Question 45: What will be the output of the following code?
```python
print("Hello", end='')

topic: "Grundlagen"
subtopic: "Ternäre-Operatoren"
level: "medium"
explanation: "The ternary conditional operator in Python takes the form `value_if_true if condition else value_if_false`. It returns the first value if the condition is true, and the second value otherwise. In this code, 20 if 5 > 3 else 10 evaluates to 20 because the condition 5 > 3 is true."
explanationWrong:
  - "The ternary operator evaluates the condition and returns one of two values."
  - "Since 5 > 3 is True, the expression returns 20."
  - "The expression is correctly formed and doesn't cause an error."

explanation: "A set comprehension in Python creates a set from an iterable, applying an expression to each element. In this code, {x**2 for x in range(5)} creates a set containing the squares of the numbers 0 through 4, which are {0, 1, 4, 9, 16}. Note that sets are unordered, so the output may show the elements in any order."
explanationWrong:
  - "The set comprehension creates a set, not a list, containing the squares."
  - "The range(5) generates numbers 0 through 4, not 1 through 5."
  - "The expression is correctly formed and doesn't cause an error."

explanation: "A generator function in Python uses the yield keyword to return values one at a time, suspending its state between calls. When next() is called on a generator, it executes until the next yield statement and returns that value. In this code, the generator yields 'a', then 'b', then 'c' in successive calls to next()."
explanationWrong:
  - "Generators use yield to return values one at a time."
  - "Each call to next() executes the function until the next yield."
  - "After yielding all values, a StopIteration exception is raised, not an error."

In this code, zip(names, scores) creates pairs like ('Alice', 85), which are then unpacked in the for loop as name and score."
explanationWrong:
  - "The zip() function pairs elements from corresponding positions in multiple iterables."
  - "The pairs are unpacked in the for loop, allowing direct access to the elements."
  - "The function and loop are correctly used and don't cause an error."

In this code, original.update({'a': 10, 'c': 3}) changes the value of 'a' to 10 and adds a new key-value pair 'c': 3."
explanationWrong:
  - "The update() method modifies the dictionary in place, adding new keys and updating existing ones."
  - "After the update, the value for 'a' changes from 1 to 10."
